class Combiner(abc.ABC):
    """Base class for all combiners.

    Combiners are objects that encapsulate aggregations and computations of
    differential private metrics. Combiners use accumulators to store the
    aggregation state. Combiners contain logic, while accumulators contain data.
    The API of combiners are inspired by Apache Beam CombineFn class.
    https://beam.apache.org/documentation/transforms/python/aggregation/combineperkey/#example-5-combining-with-a-combinefn

    Here's how PipelineDP uses combiners to performs an aggregation on some
    dataset X:
    1. Split dataset X on sub-datasets which might be kept in memory.
    2. Call create_accumulators() for each sub-dataset and keep resulting accumulators.
    3. Choosing any pair of accumulators and merge them by calling merge_accumulators().
    4. Continue 3 until 1 accumulator is left.
    5. Call compute_metrics() for the accumulator that left.

    Assumption: merge_accumulators is associative binary operation.

    The type of accumulator depends on the aggregation performed by this Combiner.
    For example, this can be a primitive type (e.g. int for a simple "count"
    aggregation) or a more complex structure (e.g. for "mean")
