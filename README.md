# PipelineDP

PipelineDP is a framework for applying differentially private aggregations to large
datasets using batch processing systems such as Apache Spark, Apache Beam,
and more.

To make differential privacy accessible to non-experts, PipelineDP:

* Provides a convenient API familiar to Spark or Beam developers.
* Encapsulates the complexities of differential privacy, such as:
  * protecting outliers and rare categories,
  * generating safe noise,
  * privacy budget accounting.
* Supports many standard computations, such as count, sum, and average. 

Additional information can be found at [pipelinedp.io](https://pipelinedp.io).

*Note* that this project is still experimental and is subject to change.
At the moment we don't recommend its usage in production systems as it's not
thoroughly tested yet. You can learn more in the
[Roadmap section](https://pipelinedp.io/overview/#roadmap).

The project is a collaboration between OpenMined and Google in an effort 
to bring Differential Privacy to production.

## Getting started

Here are some examples of how to use PipelineDP:

* [Apache Spark example](https://github.com/OpenMined/PipelineDP/blob/main/examples/movie_view_ratings/run_on_spark.py)
* [Apache Beam example](https://github.com/OpenMined/PipelineDP/blob/main/examples/movie_view_ratings/run_on_beam.py)
* [Framework-free example](https://github.com/OpenMined/PipelineDP/blob/main/examples/movie_view_ratings/run_without_frameworks.py)
* [Example with all frameworks](https://github.com/OpenMined/PipelineDP/blob/main/examples/movie_view_ratings/run_all_frameworks.py)

Please check out the [codelab](https://github.com/OpenMined/PipelineDP/blob/main/examples/restaurant_visits.ipynb) for a more detailed demonstration of the API functionality and usage.

Code sample showing private processing on Spark:
```python
# Define the privacy budget available for our computation.
budget_accountant = pipeline_dp.NaiveBudgetAccountant(total_epsilon=1,
                                                      total_delta=1e-6)

# Wrap Spark's RDD into its private version. You will use this private wrapper
# for all further processing instead of the Spark's RDD. Using the wrapper ensures
# that only private statistics can be released.
private_movie_views = \
    make_private(movie_views, budget_accountant, lambda mv: mv.user_id)

# Calculate the private sum of ratings per movie
dp_result = private_movie_views.sum(
    SumParams(
              # The aggregation key: we're grouping data by movies
              partition_extractor=lambda mv: mv.movie_id,
              # The value we're aggregating: we're summing up ratings
              value_extractor=lambda mv: mv.rating,

              # Limits to how much one user can contribute:
              # .. at most two movies rated per user
              #    (if there's more, randomly choose two)
              max_partitions_contributed=2,
              # .. at most one ratings for each movie
              max_contributions_per_partition=1,
              # .. with minimal rating of "1"
              #    (automatically clip the lesser values to "1")
              min_value=1,
              # .. and maximum rating of "5"
              #    (automatically clip the greater values to "5")
              max_value=5)
              )
budget_accountant.compute_budgets()

# Save the results
dp_result.saveAsTextFile(FLAGS.output_file)
```

## Installation

PipelineDP without any frameworks:

`pip install pipeline-dp`

If you like to run PipelineDP on Apache Spark:

`pip install pipeline-dp pyspark`

on Apache Beam:

`pip install pipeline-dp apache-beam`.

Supported Python version >= 3.7.

**Note for Apple Silicon users:** PipelineDP pip package is currently available only 
for x86 architecture. The reason is that [PyDP](https://github.com/OpenMined/PyDP) does not
have pip pacakge. It might be possible to compile it from sources for Apple Silicon.
 
## Development

To install the requirements for local development, run `make dev`.

Please run `make precommit` to auto-format, lint check, and run tests.
Individual targets are `format`, `lint`, `test`, `clean`, `dev`.

### Style guide

We use the [Google Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html).

### Running end-to-end example
When developing it is convenient to run an end-to-end example. To do this:

1. Download Netflix prize dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/netflix-inc/netflix-prize-data and unpack it.

2. The dataset itself is pretty big, to speed-up the run it's better to use a
sample of it. Here's how to take a subset of the data in bash:

   `head -10000 combined_data_1.txt > data.txt`

3. Run `python run_all_frameworks.py --input_file=<path to data.txt from 2> --output_file=<...>`
