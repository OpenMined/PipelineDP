        "\n",
        "The quality of differentially-private output might deteriorate due to several factors and depends on several parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this Colab we consider two main factors:\n",
        "1. Adding noise (e.g. using [Laplace mechanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_noise_differential_privacy_mechanisms))\n",
        "1. Limiting maximum contribution of a single individual\n",
        "\n",
        "The scale of the error introduced by noise is well-known and independent of the data. The effect of contribution bounding is more complicated.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Why contribution bounding is required\n",
        "\n",
        "[Laplace and Gaussian mechanisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_noise_differential_privacy_mechanisms) require that adding one individual to the input dataset has limited effect on the output. The maximum change is called *sensitivity*.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Why contribution bounding is complicated\n",
        "\n",
        "In a real dataset,  one inidividual can often contribute arbitrary large number of data records. In order to limit sensitivity, PipelineDP performs contribution bounding by sampling records per user, which leads to dropping some data. The error introduced by this procedure depends on the input data.\n",
        "\n",
        "This presents a **bias-variance tradeoff**:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Larger contribution bounding parameters lead to more data kept but larger noise error\n",
        "1. Smaller contribution bounding parameters lead to less data kept, smaller noise error.\n",
        "\n",
        "Contribution bounding error intoduces bias, while Laplace (or Gaussian) noise introduces variance.\n",
        "\n",
        "## What PipelineDP analysis does\n",
        "\n",
        "The analysis has two parts:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Utility Analysis** computes the error introduced by DP processing for a fixed dataset and hyper-parameters;\n",
        "1. **Parameter tuning** recommends hyper-parameters to make error smaller using utility analysis under the hood.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Note:** The recommended parameters would not necessarily be optimal. Since the analysis is designed for large distributed datasets and can be expensive, the goal is to find hyper-parameters that are \"good enough\" but not necessarily optimal.\n",

For much larger datasets, you can use PipelineDP to perform calculations on top of Apache Spark or Apache Beam. The complexity is abstracted away, so the main code wouldn't be that much different.\n",
