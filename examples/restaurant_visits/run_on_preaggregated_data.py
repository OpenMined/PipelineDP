"""This demo applies differential privacy to data that has already been
pre-aggregated. This relies on assumptions that the partitions keys are public,
and that the sensitivities of the pre-aggregated values are known.

1. Install Python and run on the command line `pip install pipeline-dp absl-py`
2. Run python run_on_preaggregated_data.py --input_file=<path to restaurants_week_data.csv> --output_file=<...>
