PipelineDP is a Python framework that lets you apply differential privacy to large datasets with batch-processing systems, such as [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) and [Apache Beam](https://beam.apache.org/). For more information about how to compute differentially private statistics in [Go](https://go.dev/), see the [Privacy on Beam](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/privacy-on-beam#0) codelab.\n",

You can achieve this outcome through _differential privacy_, a strong privacy notion of _anonymization_, which is the process of data aggregation across multiple users to protect user privacy. All anonymization methods use aggregation, but not all aggregation methods achieve anonymization. Differential privacy, on the other hand, provides measurable guarantees about information leakage and privacy.\n",

        "Now that you know how PipelineDP works, you can see how you can use it for some more advanced use cases. As mentioned at the beginning, you're interested in three statistics. PipelineDP lets you compute multiple statistics at the same time as long as those share the same parameters in the `AggregateParams` instance, which you see later. Not only is it cleaner and easier to calculate multiple metrics in one go, it's also better in terms of privacy. \n",

        "An important thing to remember about the privacy budget is that it's additive. If you run a pipeline with a particular epsilon ε and delta δ a single time, you spend an (ε,δ) budget. If you run it a second time, you spend a total budget of (2ε, 2δ). Similarly, if you compute multiple statistics with a `NaiveBudgetAccountant` method and consecutively a privacy budget of ε,δ, you spend a total budget of (2ε, 2δ). This means that you degrade the privacy guarantees.\n",

In the end, you end up with the same overall privacy guarantee, but the higher `epsilon` and `delta` values that a particular aggregation has, the higher accuracy it has.\n",

        "# Optional: Tweak the privacy and utility parameters\n",
        "Duration: 5:00\n",
        "\n",
        "You've seen quite a few parameters mentioned in this codelab, such as the `epsilon`, `delta`, and  `max_partitions_contributed` parameters. You can roughly divide them into two categories: _privacy parameters_ and _utility parameters_.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Privacy parameters \n",
        "\n",
        "The `epsilon` and `delta` parameters quantify the privacy that you provide with differential privacy. More precisely, they're a measure of how much information a potential attacker can gain about the data from the anonymized output. The higher the value of the parameters, the more information the attacker gains about the data, which is a privacy risk. On the other hand, the lower the value of the `epsilon` and `delta` parameters, the more noise you need to add to the output to make it anonymous and the higher the number of unique users that you need in each partition to keep them in the anonymized output. In this case, there's a tradeoff between utility and privacy.\n",
        "\n",
        "In PipelineDP, you need to specify your desired privacy guarantees of your anonymized output when you set the total privacy budget in the `NaiveBudgetAccountant` instance. The caveat is that if you want your privacy guarantees to hold, you need to carefully use a separate `NaiveBudgetAccountant` instance for each aggregation or run the pipeline multiple times to avoid the overuse of your budget.\n",
        "\n",
        "For more information about differential privacy and what the privacy parameters mean, see [A reading list on differential privacy](https://desfontain.es/privacy/differential-privacy-reading-list.html).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Utility parameters \n",
        "\n",
        "Utility parameters don't affect the privacy guarantees, but affect the accuracy and, consequently, the utility of the output. They're provided in the `AggregateParams` instance and used to scale the noise added.\n",
        "\n",
        "A utility parameter provided in the `AggregateParams` instance and applicable to all aggregations is the `max_partitions_contributed` parameter. A partition corresponds to a key of the data that's returned by the PipelineDP aggregation operation, so the` max_partitions_contributed` parameter bounds the number of distinct key values that a user can contribute to the output. If a user contributes to a number of keys that exceeds the value of the `max_partitions_contributed` parameter, some contributions are dropped so that they contribute to the exact value of the `max_partitions_contributed` parameter.\n",
        "\n",
        "Similarly, most aggregations have a `max_contributions_per_partition` parameter. They're also provided in the `AggregateParams` instance` `and each aggregation could have separate values for them. They bound a user’s contribution for each key.\n",
        "\n",
        "The noise added to the output is scaled by the `max_partitions_contributed` and `max_contributions_per_partition` parameters, so there's a tradeoff here: Larger values assigned to each parameter means that you keep more data, but you get a noisier result.\n",
        "\n",
        "Some aggregations require a `min_value` and `max_value` parameter, which specify the bounds for contributions of each user. If a user contributes a value lower than the value assigned to the `min_value` parameter, the value is increased to the value of the parameter. Similarly, if a user contributes a value larger than the value of the `max_value` parameter, the value is decreased to the value of the parameter. To keep more of the original values, you have to specify larger bounds. Noise is scaled by the size of the bounds, so larger bounds let you keep more data, but you end up with a noisier result.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, the `noise_kind` parameter supports two different noise mechanisms in PipelineDP: `GAUSSIAN` and `LAPLACE` noise. The `LAPLACE` distribution gives better utility with low contribution bounds, which is why PipelineDP uses it by default. However, if you want to use a `GAUSSIAN` distribution noise, you can specify it in the `AggregateParams` instance.\n",
